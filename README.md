# Vaultify â€” AI-Powered Document Verification on Solana

Vaultify is a decentralized application (dApp) that solves the inefficiencies of document verification in education and recruitment. Built on the Solana blockchain, Vaultify uses smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and AI to automate eligibility checks for job or internship applications. It significantly reduces time, error, and redundancy for students, institutions, and companies.

## Project Architecture

![Vaultify High-Level Architecture](./solana.drawio.png)

### Components

- **User Panel (Students, Institutes):**
  - Upload and manage documents
  - Generate public/private keys for secure access
  - Store data using IPFS and access via smart contract

- **Company Panel (HR, Recruiters):**
  - Post job/internship opportunities
  - Retrieve documents using public key
  - Use AI to verify candidate eligibility against job requirements

- **Smart Contract System:**
  - Manages identity, access, and audit trails
  - Verifies keys and links users to IPFS document metadata
  - Ensures traceability and on-chain validation

## Problem Statement

Current document verification processes for internships, jobs, and campus placements are highly inefficient. Students are required to repeatedly upload the same documents across multiple platforms, often leading to mismatches, outdated files, or even fake certificates. Institutes manually forward student documents to companies, increasing workload and error rates. Companies, in turn, waste time and resources reviewing unverified, ineligible candidates.

During the SAP Labs Hackfest 2025, this exact problem was highlighted by HR managers as a significant bottleneck. Manually scanning candidate documents, validating details, and communicating with multiple institutions leads to major time and cost overheads.

## Solution

Vaultify solves this problem by offering a decentralized, AI-powered platform:

1. **One-Time Document Upload**
   - Students upload academic documents to IPFS via the user panel.
   - IPFS returns a URI that is linked through a smart contract on Solana.

2. **Key-Based Access Control**
   - Each document set is associated with a public key (view-only) and a private key (edit access).
   - Students can share public keys with recruiters, allowing secure read access to documents.
   - Institutions use private keys to update semester-wise records as needed.

3. **Smart Contract Verification**
   - All public key access is validated through smart contracts.
   - Unauthorized access is automatically blocked.

4. **AI Eligibility Bot**
   - Companies define requirements in vacancy forms.
   - When a student submits their public key, AI scans their documents to determine eligibility.
   - Only eligible profiles are stored and processed by the company.

5. **Decentralized Workflow**
   - Institutes no longer need to send documents manually.
   - Companies no longer need to validate raw certificates one-by-one.
   - Everything is verified and tracked on-chain.
